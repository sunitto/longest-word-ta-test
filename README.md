Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
This was my attempt to create an app for a Teacher Assistant Test. We had few hours to do our best.
I did not make the cut but it was a great exercise.
